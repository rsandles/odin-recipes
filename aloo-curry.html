            <li>½ cup chopped <strong>onions</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup of tightly packed chopped <strong>tomatoes</strong></li>
            <li>½ teaspoon <strong>turmeric powder</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <strong>kashmiri red chilli powder</strong></li>
            <li>½ teaspoon <strong>coriander powder</strong></li>
            <li>½ teaspoon <strong>garam masala powder</strong></li>
            <li>½ teaspoon <strong>cumin powder</strong> (optional)</li>
            <li>1 finely chopped <strong>green chili</strong></li>
            <li>4 medium sized <strong>potatoes</strong>, diced</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a pan or kadai. Add ½ teaspoon finely chopped garlic and saute for a few seconds. No need to brown garlic. You can also add 2 tablespoons oil.
                You can use any neutral flavored oil. For this recipe, I prefer to use peanut oil. However you can also make it in sunflower oil, canola oil, avocado oil or grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li>Next add ½ cup chopped onions.</li>
            <li>Sauté until the onions turn translucent on a medium-low heat. Keep on stirring in intervals.</li>
            <li>Then add 1 cup of tightly packed chopped tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with its lid and simmer on a low heat until the tomatoes soften and become mushy. Do check a couple of times when the tomatoes are cooking.</li>
            <li>Cook until the tomatoes soften and become mushy.</li>
            <li>When the tomatoes have softened well, then add ½ teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder (or ½ teaspoon regular red chilli powder or cayenne pepper), ½ teaspoon coriander powder, ½ teaspoon garam masala powder and ½ teaspoon cumin powder (optional).</li>
            <li>Mix the spice powders very well with the onion-tomato mixture.</li>
            <li>Then add diced potatoes (4 medium sized potatoes, diced). Also season with salt as required.</li>
            <li>Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 cups of water and stir well.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with its lid and simmer on a medium to medium-high flame until the potatoes are cooked.</li>
            <li>Do check a couple of times when your curry is simmering.</li>
            <li>The aloo curry will thicken slightly by the time the potatoes are done. You will also see some oil specks on the top of the gravy.</li>
            <li>Then switch off the heat and add ¼ cup chopped coriander leaves (cilantro). Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Serve potato curry hot or warm.</li>
        </ol>
